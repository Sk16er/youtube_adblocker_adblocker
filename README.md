## Script Breakdown üîç

### 1. **Remove YouTube Adblock Warnings**

- **What It Does**: 
  - This script **automatically dismisses** the "Adblocker Detected" warning that YouTube displays when it detects that you're using an ad blocker.
  - It automatically clicks the "Dismiss" button for you, allowing you to continue watching videos without interruption.

- **How It Works**:
  - The script constantly checks for the presence of the warning banner on YouTube. 
  - Once the banner is detected, it clicks the dismiss button and automatically resumes playback.

```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';
    var player = document.getElementById("movie_player");
    var closeit = setInterval(function() {
        if(document.getElementsByClassName("style-scope ytd-popup-container").length > 0 && document.getElementById("dismiss-button") && document.getElementById("divider")) {
            setTimeout(function(){
                document.getElementById("dismiss-button").click();
                document.getElementsByClassName("ytp-play-button ytp-button")[0].click();
                console.log("banner closed");
                clearInterval(closeit);
            }, 4000);
        }
    }, 300);
})();

```
# YouTube No Preroll Ads (Beta)
- What It Does:

   - This bypasses the preroll ads that appear before YouTube videos.
  - It prevents YouTube from showing the ad entirely, allowing you to jump straight into the video.
### How It Works:

- The script automatically detects when a preroll ad is about to play and skips it before it starts.
- As this is still in beta, it might not work perfectly on all videos or for all users.
  ``` javascript
  (function() {
    'use strict';
    // Preroll ad bypass logic here
  })();

# Compatibility üíª
- The scripts are designed to work across all major browsers that support Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, including:
> Google Chrome
> Mozilla Firefox
> Microsoft Edge
> Safari (with userscript support)
## Notes üìù
- Beta Limitations: The "No Preroll Ads" feature is still in development and may not work with all YouTube videos or may break after YouTube updates its platform.
- Adblock Detection: YouTube might occasionally change its method of detecting adblockers, which could break the functionality of these scripts. Please check for script updates regularly.
- Legal Disclaimer: These scripts bypass ads that YouTube uses to monetize its platform. Use them responsibly and understand that such usage may violate YouTube's Terms of Service.
